# Restaurant-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction


Overview

This project aims to predict the success of restaurants in Bengaluru, India, using a dataset from Zomato, a popular restaurant review and food delivery platform. Bengaluru is a diverse and bustling city with a thriving restaurant industry, making it an ideal location to explore the factors affecting restaurant success. With over 12,000 restaurants in the city, both new and established establishments face challenges in a competitive market.

The project begins by analyzing the Zomato dataset, which includes information about restaurants' location, pricing, themes, and customer reviews. The goal is to provide insights into what makes a restaurant successful in this dynamic culinary landscape.

Data Source

The data used in this project was scraped from the Zomato website in two phases. Phase I involved collecting basic information such as the URL, restaurant name, and address for each restaurant visible on the Zomato front page. In Phase II, detailed data for each restaurant was scraped, including information on online ordering, table booking, ratings, votes, contact details, location, restaurant type, dish preferences, cuisines, pricing, reviews, and menu items.
